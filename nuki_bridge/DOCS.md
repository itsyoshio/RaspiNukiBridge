# Home Assistant Virtual Nuki Bridge

Use this instead of the [Nuki Bridge](https://nuki.io/en/bridge/) device.

> Important - if you are experiencing delays using RPI, it is advised to use a bluetooth dongle instead of the builtin bluetooth hardware.
> [TP-LINK UB400](https://www.tp-link.com/us/home-networking/usb-adapter/ub400/) is verified to be working.

## Pairing

1. Press the button of the Nuki Smart Lock for 6 seconds. It should light up.
2. Run

   1. If installed as addon, click `start`
   2. If installed outside HA, run

      `python .`

3. Look in logs for:

   ```
   ********************************************************************
   *                                                                  *
   *                         Pairing completed!                       *
   *                            Access Token                          *
   * abcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabca *
   *                                                                  *
   ********************************************************************
   ```

4. Copy the `Access Token` for a following step.

   In case you missed it, restart the service and check again.
